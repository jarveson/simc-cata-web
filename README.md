Simc web assembly ui helper

build simc / wasm branch here, based on cata but same idea [https://github.com/jarveson/simc/tree/jake/wasm_branch]

put `engine.js/engine.wasm/engine.worker.js` in `static`, worker.js only needed with pthreads
put `engine.js` in `src/engine.js`

`npm start` or `npm build`
